AID	Category	target(Organism)	CP-relevance	Description
1030	Other		ALDH1A1	(h. Sapiens)	medium		ALDH1A1 is a aldehyd dehydrogenase and is mostly associated with alcohol metabolism. Also other aldehyds that might be toxic to the human body are neutralized by ALDH1A1; therefore inhibition of this enzyme might be related to toxic effects. It appears that it also oxidizes retinol which is also toxic in large doses to retinoic acid. 
1458	Other		SMN2(h. Sapiens)	high		assay that scans for enhancers for survival of motor neuron (SMN). This protein is essential for transcriptional regulation, telomerase regeneration and cellular trafficking. It is present in the cytoplasm of all animal cells and also neuclear gems. There are two loci that are associated with SMN which would be SMN1 and SMN2. SMN1 might be affected by mutations and SMN2 is only viable in 10 percent of the expressions, since it skips essential exon 7 90% of the time. Enhancing SMN2 is measured in this bioassay as a substitute for a damaged SMN1
1529	Other		MEK5-MEKK3-PBi(sapiens)	high		PB1-domains are binding sites found in several humanoid proteins that facilitate the formation of heterodimers for signalling pathway interactions (among others). The MEK5 (MAP2K-family) binds to MEKK2 and MEKK3 (MAP3K-family) via such a binding domain. These two Kinases govern the ERK5-signalling pathway that is involved in angiogenesis, cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis. It is noteworthy that the PB-1 domain here utilizes inhibition prone beta grasp topology instead beta sheet interactions. Hence, compounds that activate or inhibit the pb1-domain are considered active in this assay.
1531	Other		MEK5-MEKK2-PBi(sapiens) high		see AID '1529'
1578	Other		NOD1 (human)		low		NOD1 is an enzyme that is highly related wiht inflammtion apoptosis and auto-immune responses.The enzyme is only expressed in dendritic cells and macophages and epithelial cells. Bone-cancer cells are very unlikely to express that enzyme and even if the regulation of NOD1 might have cytotoxicity related impacts since it activates NF-kB it is most likely not expressed in U2OS Cells used in CP
1688	Other		huntingtin(humans)	low		huntingtin is a protein that is mutated to have many glutamine repeat in chorea huntingktion patients. These mutated ptroteins tend to aggregate and cause cell death especially in the brain. it is however expressed in every tissue of the human body. However questionable if effects are als present in somatic tissue.
1822	Other		M18AAP(plasmodium)	low		m18AAP is a peptidase tht cuts protiens found in the host cells infiltrted by plasmodium. It is not very likely to predict its regulation via CP assay
2098	Other		HSF1(Mouse)		high		HSF1 is a stress response protein that becomes active upon a variety of stressors such as heat, dna damage and contaminants. it activates genes that encode cytoprotective genes.
2156	Other		KCNQ2(rat)		low		KCNQ2 is found in neuronal tissue and therefore is less likely to be important for CP assay
2216	Other		Ran-Proteincomplex	high		Ran is a protein very important for mitosis and regulates nuclear transport during interphase. During mitosis it binds to importin beta and this very binding is probed by small molecules in this bioassay. The function is very fundamental and Ran is found in all eukaryotic cells, however its function seems to be a bit cell cycle dependent.
2330	Other		STK-33(human)		high		STK33 phosphorylates VIME. May play a specific role in the dynamic behavior of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of VIME (By similarity). The cell line AML seems to not be dependent on STK which i do not really understant because how can viability be measured if some cells (not transformed) do not die, whereas other (transformed) cells die upon STK-Inhibition. However this is a viability screening and therefore very much related to cytotoxicity, since STK is expressed in every cell that contains intermediate filaments.
2540	Other		SENP8(human)		high		SENP8 is a protein that serves the NEDD8 pathway. It is processing NEDD8 to its mature form and deconjugates NEDD8 from its targets. NEDD8 on the other hand plays an important role for DNA repair, transcription and cell-contacts
2553	Other		TRPC(mouse)		low		only sensory cells are targeted by this assay
2599	Other		SENP6(human)		high		has several functions within cells, among chromosome alignment and spindle formation. More precisely, it protects CENPI from degradation which is part of a kinetochore complex. Deconjugtaes poly-SUMO2 and -SUMO3 chains from targets, SUMO1 less effectively. SUMO-Proteins play vital roles in major cell processes like replication, transcription, repair, proteolysis and many more. Misregulation of SUMO-Proteins results in diseases like diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases among others.
2642	Other		KCNQ1(humans)		low		only for sensory cells
2796	Other		AHR(humans)		high		AHR is a ligand activated transcription factor that detects aromatic hydrogencarbons and regulates the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (CYT450, ALDH and other detoxification genes). Upon binding, AHR translocates to the nucleus, where it dimerizes and influences target gene transcription.
485270	Other		OX1R(humans)		low		OX1R is mostly present in brain cells and is associated with addiction and other neuro-cellular properties.
485313	Other		NPC1(humans)		low		NPC1 is a protein very relevant in a rare lipidosis where it is mutated in a malicious way
485314	Other		POLB(humans)		high		POLB performs Base excision repair especially in mitochondria where the dna is constantly under attack from ROS. Overexpressions has been correlated with some cancer types (might be relevant since CP uses cancer cell lines) and underexpression is related to apoptosis and chromosomal breaking. Wikipedia states that POLB is very tightly regulated
504333	Other		BAZ2B(humans)		medium		protein function is not yet elucidated, hence the assay. Results could be relevant to CP or not. nobody knows
504444	Other		Nrf2(humans)		high		Nrf2(transcription factor maintains cellular redox homeostasis. It binds to ARE which induces a variety of antioxidant and anti-xenobiotic en. Some cancer cells have enhanced activity of Nrf2 which protects them further from radiation, cytotoxic substances and similar (could be relevant since cancer cell line in use for CP). 
504466	Toxicity	ELG1(humans)		high		ELG1 is a protein expressed during genotoxicity and genetic stress. the cell line used here is embryonic kidney cells, hence there is the question of transferability but the general outline of this assay is to probe genetic stress and the blockage of DNA replication. As the official target ATAD5 is specified, but that is not comprehensible from the assay descripton of pubchem.	
504582	Toxicity	HSP40(yeast)		low		the hsp40 is the heat shock protein 40 and evidence suggests that P. Falciparium uses this co chaperone protein to infect and kill cells. This assay probes the potential of small molecules to block malaria induced hsp40 toxicity in yeast cells.
504652	Other		D1 DAR (humans)		low		is mostly relevant for neuronal cells
504660	Other		D1 DAR (humans)         low             is mostly relevant for neuronal cells
504847	Other		VDRA(humans)		medium		VDR is a transcription factor stimulated by vitamin D and activates a variety of different genes. For this assay the regulative mechanism on  hormones and calcium levels are mentioned, which are not that important for the U2OS cell line but maybe the vitamin D receptor has a function for those nonetheless. It also depends on the medium the cells received. If there is no Vitamin D in the medium, VDRA is not activated regardless.
588334	Other		TRPM-1/MITF		medium		the description is suprisingly undescriptive. MITF and TRPM-1 however are important for cell survival and other macroscopic cellular features so it might be relevant for the CP-data
588458	Other		DNMT1(humans)		medium		DNA methyl transferase 1 is responsible for the methylation maintenance of genomic methylation pattern (what ever that means). Abnormal, abberrant methylation patterns are related to several humane cancers. This assay probes for inhibitors of DNMT1. DNMT1 for example methylates the new daughter DNA strands during interphase, so that epigenetic information is hereditary to the daughter dna. This manipulation is on a very low biochemical level and the implications of an artificial regulation of DNMT1 are not completely understood, hence is the importance of this assay to cell painting
588852	Other		mAChR(humans)		low		concerns mostly CNS-receptors
588855	Other		Smad3(humans)		high		Smad3 is part of the TGF-pathway that has several cellular and developmental implications. However the TGF-family comprises of cytokines that is mostly responsible for developping tissue of certain organs and the healing process. SMAD3 serves as a signal transducer that is critical for cell growth and development
602340	Toxicity	C2C12-cells		medium		very abstract concept. They try to find compounds that counteract on the decrease of ATP-levels in mouse myotubes induced by simvastatin.
624202	Other		BRCA1(humans)		medium		BRCA1 has been implicated in a wide array of cellular activities, including DNA damage repair, cell-cycle checkpoint control, growth inhibition, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, protein ubiquitylation, and mammary stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. However it is mostly associated with different cancers since it's function (tumor suppressing) is deactivated in Mammacarcinom, Ovarialcarcinom, coloncarcinom) und prostatecarcinom. The function of this protein in U2OS cells is not illuminated and might differ from healthy cells by a margin, which is why this assay is only labelled medium
624256	Other		ac.-myld.-leuk-c.-diff.	low		very specific assay that covers the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. The arrest is induced by the protein HoxA9 and the small molecules are supposed to reverse that arrest. Seems to be very specific, also the special thing about this assay is the cultivation method rather that the cellular effect, which is also not very relevant for U2OS-Cells
624296	Other		geminin(humans)		medium		this assay does not only probe geminin but a palette of replication regulatory proteins: cyclin A, Cdt-1, Cdc6 and geminin. Re-replication of DNA is a pathogenic symptom caused by misregulation of said proteins that results in apoptosis. Therefore this assay is measuring the dna content of the cell nuclei which could be predictable with a cell painting assay since the ways of measurement are quite similar. However the cell line used here was MCF 10a normal breast cells.
624297	Other		geminin(humans)		medium		see '624296' but with SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells.
