    "### Correction of the ML-Ready Cell-Painting Data Sets\n",
    "#### Prerequisite\n",
    "This notebook is part of the master thesis of Luis Vollmers. It uses the cell paintin data set of Bray et al. and the goal of the project is to predict pubchem assay data. Originally this notebook was concerned with pubchem AID 1030 but this might be subject to change.\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "The datasets generated in ml_ready of step 01 comprise several mistakes that have been made and that need to be corrected within this jupyter notebook. Mostly, the compounds listed in the rows of the ML-ready dataframes are not unique, due to a misunderstanding stemming from the Bray et al Cell-Painting paper. It was stated that the Metadata_broad_sample is a unique identifier which was found to be wrong. Identical compounds which were used in different concentrations and/or on different well-plates were assigned different Metadata_broad_sample values. This needs to be corrected as well as the averaging over the different column values. In the data columns, the cell painting features are listed and so far the algorithm just kept the first concentration and took the average of the respective multiplicates. The correct way of doing it however is to check how many concentrations are present and then take the median of the concentration that is most frequent which is done by this jupyter notebook. \n",
    "#### Summary of the steps in this notebook\n",
    "1. Import the ML-ready pubchem-assay and the preprocessed cell-painting raw data\n",
    "2. Reintroduce the center median data into the pubchem df\n",
    "3. Treat the multi-concentration Compounds adequately\n",
    "4. Export the output\n"
