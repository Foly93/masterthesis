    "### Generating Molecular Fingerprints for the assay data\n",
    "This notebook serves as a first approach to workout a pipeline to generate the molecular fingerprints of the pubchem assay data. It is part of the master's thesis of Luis Vollmers. To generate the finger prints the following steps are undertaken:\n",
    "1. read the input\n",
    "2. generate Morgan Fingerprints\n",
    "3. Append the Morgan Fingerprints to the DF\n",
    "4. Export the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the pubchem assays have been preprocessed, so that their compounds overlap with the cell painting data set in question and only relevant activity columns are kept as categorization columns for machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The output of this notebook is a csv file that has the dimensions 5021x2058. The columsn contain meta data labels aswell as the morgan fingerprint bitvector assigned by integer numbers. The rows are assigned to unique compounds identifiable by the 'CAN_SMILES' column."
